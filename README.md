# simple-wordlist-generator

This is a very simple tool that can turn single words into all possible upper-/lowercase variants.

Example:
```
input: test
output: test tesT teSt ... TEsT TESt TEST
```

# Caution! Very unoptimized ugly code

I made this tool for myself, because I was unable to find any other tool similar to this.

I'm too lazy to make it better. Pull requests are welcomed tho.
